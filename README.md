## ⭐ STAR Summary

**Situation**  
Design of a patient-specific hand orthosis required balancing functional needs, ergonomics, and safety while ensuring systematic engineering documentation.  

**Task**  
Develop a structured concept that fulfills all requirements, provides a clear functional breakdown, and is validated through systematic evaluation.  

**Action**  
- Compiled a consolidated **requirements list** covering functional & non-functional needs.  
- Developed the **functional structure** to map overall functions and safety aspects.  
- Applied a **concept evaluation matrix** to compare design alternatives and select the optimal solution.  

**Result**  
- Delivered a **validated concept** aligned with stakeholder requirements.  
- Ensured structured traceability from needs → functions → concept.  
- Provided engineering justification through transparent evaluation criteria.
